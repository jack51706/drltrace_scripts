# Description

The script allows to perform visualization of a trace of library calls provided in the following format 
(arguments are ignored):

*<library_name>!<library_call_name>*

Each unique library call is assigned with unique color from RGB or grayscale pallette. The tool generates an 
image where each pixel represents library call from a trace.

**Example:**

While the script was mainly developed to visualize an output of [drltrace](https://github.com/DynamoRIO/drmemory/tree/master/drltrace) tool, the script is possible to use for custom traces provided in the appropriate format.
